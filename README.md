For all Terraform projects you will need to generate a PEM file in AWS to ssh into your servers. You can call it whatever you would like, but be sure to change the name in the Terraform configuration to whatever you set.

You will also need to subscribe to the following AWS Marketplace AMIs to query them properly if using Terraform:
- Ubuntu: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07CQ33QKV
- Kali: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B08LL91KKB
